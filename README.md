# Pangenome
**This repository is associated with genomic analysis of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae* bacteria**.

## Download of genomes

*P. aeruginosa* and *K. pneumoniae* genomes were obtained from NCBI/RefSeq on 11/29/2022. At this date, 7249 genomes were available for *P. aeruginosa* in RefSeq. On the other hand, for *K. pnuemoniae* 15064 genomes were available in RefSeq.



## Workflow used in genome analysis
## MLST typing of *P. aeruginosa* and *K. pneumoniae* genomes
The genomes of *P. aeruginosa* were typed with the script available at (https://github.com/tseemann/mlst) using the MLST scheme for *P. aeruginosa*.
